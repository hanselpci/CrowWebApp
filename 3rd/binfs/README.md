## binfs

This package converts any file into manageable C++ source code. It is useful for embedding binary or text data into a C++ program.

### Installation

To compile and install the library use the following (MacOS & Linux):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bleenco/binfs.git
cd binfs/
make
make install
```

To compile program on Windows follow this steps (assuming you have CMake installed):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bleenco/binfs.git
cd binfs/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Usage

Conversion is done on one or more sets of files. They are all embedded in a new C++ source file.

The simplest invocation generates a `binfs.hpp` file in the current working directory. It include all files recursively from the `data/` directory.

```sh
$ binfs data/
```

To specify the name of the output file being generated, we use the following:

```sh
$ binfs -o myfile.hpp data/
```

Multiple input directories or files can be specified if necessary.

```sh
$ binfs data/ data2/ /path/to/image.png /path/to/my_video.mp4
```

### Accessing the asset

To access asset data, we use the `binfs->get_file(filepath);` function which is included in the generated output.

```c++
#include <string>
#include <fstream>
#include "bindata.hpp"

int main()
{
  BinFS::BinFS *binfs = new BinFS::BinFS();
  binfs->init(); // load the files

  std::string txt_file = binfs->get_file("data/CMakeLists.txt");
  std::string video_file = binfs->get_file("/path/to/my_video.mp4");

  // write accessed video data into output file
  std::ofstream output("out.mp4", std::fstream::binary);
  output << video_file;

  return 0;
}
```

### Optional compression

Not yet implemented.
